# TwinklyController

## Running
Running `Main` will start one of the two modes. With no arguments, it will start the GUI. If you pass arguments, it will pass those to `CLI`.

## Movie Format
Movies to be uploaded to the device should be stored as any type of image that Java can read (GIF, PNG, JPEG, BMP, and WBMP). The image's width should be the same as the number of lights in your string and the height is the number of frames in the animation.
